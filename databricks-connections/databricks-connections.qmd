```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(sparklyr)
```

A simple example notebook highlighting how to connect to Databricks using a variety of tools and SDKs.
# R Connections
## sparklyr connection
These connections are best for working interactively with Databricks compute clusters. This is only necessary when actually doing something that requires Spark functionality.
```{r}
sc <- spark_connect(
  cluster_id = "0429-230927-itlk4yp",
  method = "databricks_connect"
)
```

## ODBC Connection
```{r}

```

# Python Connections
## Pyspark Connection
```{python}

```

## Python SDK
```{python}
from databricks.sdk import WorkspaceClient

w = WorkspaceClient()

for c in w.clusters.list():
  print(f"Cluster name: {c.cluster_name} - {c.cluster_id}")
```
